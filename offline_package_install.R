# Download the packages to the working directory.
# Package names and filenames are returned in a matrix.
# The files can be written directly to a USB drive, or just put on desktop.
# The folder that you create can be copied anywhere (say from desktop to USB drive) when ready to do the offline install

#------------Installing packages offline------------------- 
# Assuming weâ€™ve downloaded our packages to a USB stick or similar, on site and without an
# internet connection we can now install the packages from disk.

# Set working directory to the location of the package files
# in this case, an file on a usb disk
setwd("E:/offline r packages/")

# Read the package filenames and install
pkgFilenames <- read.csv("pkgFilenames.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)[, 1]
install.packages(pkgFilenames, repos = NULL, type = "win.binary")

#Packages should now be installed. 
#Confirm that packages are installed by checking them out using library.
#Example:  library(tidyverse)
